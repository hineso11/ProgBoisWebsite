					<p> RSA cryptography is an <!-- Should be spelled asymmetric --> a-symetric encryption method that relies on computational power to create keys and to encrypt/decrypt messages. Without powerful computers this encryption method would not work. Its important that RSA is usable because internet communications means that secure connections need to be made without meeting to exchange keys. <!-- Asymmetric --> Asymetric encryption means that the encryption key can be publicly shown and all messages encrypted with that key can only be decrypted by holders of the decryption key ie the <!-- intended --> indended recipient. Public and private keys can also be used to guarantee the sender as only they can encrypt the message such that it can be decrypted with the public key.

					<h3> The threat of quamtum computing </h3>
					<img src="quantumimg.jpeg" alt ="">
					<p> Computer technology could make RSA cryptography obsolete. RSA cryptography relies on the difficulty of factoring numbers, using typical computers the best known algorithms to find factors have sob-exponential time complexity making it nearly impossible to solve. However Peter Shor has described an algorithm in 1994 that, utilizing quantum Fourier transforms, can find factors in polynomial time. This would deal a great blow to RSA cryptography allowing all messages to be <!-- deciphered --> decipherd. <!-- Many --> many cryptographers are looking for <!-- quantum-proof --> quantumproof encryption methods.
