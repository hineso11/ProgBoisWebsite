### Encryption page ###


1. Interest of content.

Good - I personally am very interested in encryption and have done lots of work on it in the past, so I appreciate and approve of the content choice. Whilst the content is quite interesting, especially to me, I have to admit that it is lacking in quantity, with only two paragraphs in total.


2. Consistency and quality of visual presentation

Sound - It is good that you have used the same styles for the headers 'RSA cryptograhy' and 'The threat of quantum computing', although you have spelt 'quantum' incorrectly.
I like the image used to illustrate RSA encryption, although I think it should be larger so that the user can read the text on the image.
The navigation bar only has a valid link to the home page and one other member's page. This means that you cannot actually navigate around between the different pages, because even the home page doesn't have a link to this encryption page. There are no links anywhere on the other pages that link to this encyrption page.

3. Quality of written presentation

Sound - There are many spelling errors in this page: 'a-symetric', 'asymetric', 'indended', 'quamtum', 'sob-exponential', 'decipherd'. As well as grammatical errors such as "its" rather than "it's", and words at the start of a sentence are not always capitalised, such as the last sentence.

4. Validity of HTML

Outstanding - I ran the HTML through the w3 HTML checker and it only came up with one error, which was for the RSA image tag containing a 'width' attribute with no value, so that just needs to be removed. Apart from this one small error, the HTML is perfectly valid, which is outstanding.

5. Evidence of collaboration.
- Author info not written by author

Weak - There appears to be no information about the author of this page.

- Balanced contributions from members

Good - There appears to be a good balance in terms of the levels of contribution from all the different members of the group. However, there also appears to have been a lack of communication of somekind, because many of the pages don't contain valid links to any of the other pages. The 'silk road' page appears to have zero links to the other pages.

- Not completed at the last minute

Good - Looking at the commit history for the page, it was first committed 18 hours ago as of when I am reviewing this.
